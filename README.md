The contents of the arcsyn directory come from https://github.com/wchristian/gltut, and the component needed from there is OpenGL::Debug.

Additionally this OpenGL wrapper is needed: https://github.com/wchristian/OpenGL.pm/tree/gltut

Additionally this ImageMagick package is needed on windows: http://www.imagemagick.org/download/binaries/ImageMagick-6.9.5-10-Q16-x86-dll.exe Due to age and bitrot, it will require a "force install Image::Magick" on the CPAN shell.
